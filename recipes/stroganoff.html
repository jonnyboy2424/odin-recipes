      <p>
        This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean version, as most
        recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to
        your tastes. I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to
        coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.

      <div class="required-recipes">
        <ul>
          <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips</li>

          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
          <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
          <li>½ medium onion, sliced or diced</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>½ cup white wine</li>
          <li>2 cups beef broth, divided</li>
          <li>¾ cup creme fraiche</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon fresh chopped chives</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in
        beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid
        evaporates and meat browns.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        Remove meat from the pan and set aside. Stir mushrooms, onions, and
        butter into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables are
        lightly browned.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
        Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 to 2
        minutes until incorporated. Stir in wine and 1 cup of broth, scraping
        the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and
        cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
        Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of broth; bring to a
        simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, covered, until beef is
        tender and sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
        Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to
        taste.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
