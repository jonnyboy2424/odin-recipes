        This beer cheese soup is delicious. As a Wisconsin native, I'm
        accustomed to a fantastic beer cheese soup. This recipe is a salute to
        my home state, America's dairy land, and a state that brews a mighty
        fine beer. Serve with lots of popcorn floating on top!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 slices thick cut bacon, chopped (Optional)</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups diced carrots</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups diced celery</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic (about 6 cloves)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) bottle pilsner-style beer</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk or half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>12 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>popped plain or salted popcorn, for garnish</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Heat bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper
        towel-lined plate, reserving drippings.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        Add carrots, onion, and celery to drippings and increase heat to
        medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8
        minutes. Stir in garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne; cook, stirring
        constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
        Add butter and cook, stirring constantly, until melted. Add flour and
        cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
        Stir in beer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2
        minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
        Stir in broth and half-and-half; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium
        to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, just until mixture
        lightly coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>
        Stir in Dijon, Worcestershire, dry mustard, and hot sauce until fully
        incorporated. Remove from heat.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <p>
        Add cheese, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until melted before
        adding more.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 9</h3>
      <p>Serve hot, topped with popcorn and reserved bacon.</p>
