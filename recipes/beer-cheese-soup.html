        This beer cheese soup is delicious. As a Wisconsin native, I'm
        accustomed to a fantastic beer cheese soup. This recipe is a salute to
        my home state, America's dairy land, and a state that brews a mighty
        fine beer. Serve with lots of popcorn floating on top!

      <ul>
        <li>Bacon: Bacon is optional, but it adds a deep meaty flavor.</li>
        <li>
          From the vegetable aisle, you’ll need onions, carrots, and celery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season the beer cheese soup with fresh garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne
          pepper, and dry mustard.
