        flavor of the traditional dish with a little of the fat and hassle

      <ul>
        <li>
            Noodles: This chicken cordon bleu casserole recipe starts with a
            package of wide egg noodles.
        <li>
            Chicken and ham: You’ll need cooked, cubed chicken and cooked, cubed
            ham. This is a great use for leftover meat, if you have it.
        </li>        
        <li>
          Cheese: Melt Swiss cheese alongside the chicken and ham in the casserole. Parmesan cheese is essential for the crispy topping. </li>
